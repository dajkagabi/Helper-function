# Helper-function

We can also use the return value of a function inside another function. These functions being called within another function are often referred to as helper functions. Since each function is carrying out a specific task, it makes our code easier to read and debug if necessary. 

The previous exercise, we created a function to find the number of monitors to order for an office. Now letâ€™s write another function that uses the monitorCount function to figure out the price.![code8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70899647/211166858-61aa10f5-8086-481c-ab53-2383aca3204b.png)
